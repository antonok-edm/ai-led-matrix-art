# AI for Pixelblaze IDE

Let GPT-4 and GPT-4 with Vision write code for a [Pixelblaze](https://electromage.com/pixelblaze)-controlled LED matrix, evolving over time towards a user-defined theme.

## How to use

- Modify the first two variable values in `index.js`:
    - `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY` is your OpenAI API key
    - `userGoal` describes a theme that you want the art to visually evolve towards
- Connect to your Pixelblaze's web IDE
- Configure the appropriate controller type, speed, and size
- Enter the `Edit` tab to begin drafting a new pattern
- Paste the code from `index.js` into the devtools console
- Wait for OpenAI servers
- Enjoy the light show!
